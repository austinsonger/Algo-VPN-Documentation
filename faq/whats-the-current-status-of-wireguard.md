# What's the current status of WireGuard?



[WireGuard is a work in progress](https://www.wireguard.com/#work-in-progress). It has undergone [substantial](https://www.wireguard.com/formal-verification/) security review, however, its authors are appropriately cautious about its safety and the protocol is subject to change. As a result, WireGuard does not yet have a "stable" 1.0 release. Releases are tagged with their build date -- "0.0.YYYYMMDD" -- and users should be advised to apply new updates when they are available.
